# genHEX
Methods and data for generalized design of heat exchangers. 

## what is changed in this fork
there are a number of places that have 1-D numpy arrays that throw up errors. Add .item() to the end of these

------- HOW TO USE IT -------
The easiest setup method is:

from GenHEX_main import *

//if you want to create a new setup file, just edit the filename and run
main(function="Create setup file", filename="Default.xlsx")
//you could also copy and rename another setup file
//after changing the fluid and hex inputs, CLOSE the xlsx file and run

// Run in deign mode:
// Will estimate what Generalized Geometrical Parameters is suitable for your application
main(function="Estimate GGPs", filename="Default.xlsx")

// Run in off-deign mode:
// Requires a defined heat exchanger, but keeps it fixed and allows for varying the fluid stream properties
main(function="Run", filename="Default.xlsx")

//all output parameters are written to the setup file but in output tabs
